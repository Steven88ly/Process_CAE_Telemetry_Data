Hi!

This is my first ever Python project. This doesn't mean it's my firsttime developing though. I have a background in full stack development and now i am picking up python.
This project will exercise my python development skills and focuses on parsing datapoints from csv files, creating dataframes, and creating information using pandas and myplotlib.
I will be using CAE's telemetry data of an aircraft's flight to determine what kind of manoeuver is being performed and using the dataframes created i will calculate the pitch angle at touchdown, distance travelled after touchdown and the average airspeed of aircraft while in air.
